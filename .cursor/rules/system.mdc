# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Technology Stack
- Bun.sh runtime environment
- Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
- Bun.sh SQLite for database operations
- We use ES6 imports instead of CS require. 
ALWAYS USE ES6 IMPORTS

We comment our code as much as possible. 

We run our test server on port 3636 utilizing our --port argument.

Every file in api/ should be executable from the command line as well as importable from another JS file.

We utilize custom HTML Elements as much as possible. We try to have flat components whenever possible -- we try to avoid nested divs.
