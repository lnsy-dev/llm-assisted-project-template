We do not use shadow DOM. Do not use Shadow DOM. Do not include CSS inside our javascript -- use the components .css file for this. Do not import CSS from JS. 

We use custom HTML components as much as possible. 

The components look like:

```js

class ElementName extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback(){
  }

  static get observedAttributes() {
    return [];
  }

  attributeChangedCallback(name, old_value, new_value){
    switch(name){
      default:
    }
  }

}

customElements.define('ElementTagName', ElementName)

```

Please break up larger components into smaller components. And so, for instance, a modal should be its own component. A tab should be its own component. A set of dropdowns should be their own component.
