# Server Management Rules

## Auto-Reload Behavior

1. **No Manual Server Restarts Required**
   - The development server automatically reloads when changes are detected
   - Do not manually start or restart the server
   - All file changes trigger automatic reloading

2. **Server Configuration**
   - Server runs on port 5454 by default
   - Configuration changes are applied automatically
   - WebSocket connections are automatically managed

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Continue making changes to files as needed
   - Server will detect and apply changes in real-time
   - No need to run `bun run server.js` or similar commands

4. **Debugging**
   - Server logs are available in real-time
   - Errors will be displayed in the console automatically
   - No need to restart server to see error messages

5. **Best Practices**
   - Always check console for current server status
   - Let the auto-reload handle file changes
   - Don't manually interfere with the running server process
